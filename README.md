### About Me

Hi, I'm Th√©o, an economics major who got interested in applying statistical and machine learning models to problems related to sustainability. I bring together my background in economics and machine-learning to be a more well-rounded data scientist. In my opinion, economics and data-science overlap in lots of way. Both disciplines are interested in solving optimization and maximization problems, whether it relates to consumer goods, services, or monetary policy. As such, I try to introduce economic concepts into many of my projects.  

I am still quite new to Github and I'm looking to build a bigger presence here. If you have any recommendations or ideas on what to improve, feel free to reach out :)
